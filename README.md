Install git
-------------------
**GIT**: A free and open-source version control system designed to projects of all sizes with speed

Follow the instructions (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install git (if it's not already installed). Note that for this tutorial we will be using git on the command line only. While there are some great git GUIs (graphical user interfaces), I think it's easier to learn git using git-specific commands first and then to try out a git GUI once you're more comfortable with the command.
